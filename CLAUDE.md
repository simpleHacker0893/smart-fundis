## Agent skills

### Issue tracker

Issues live in GitHub Issues on this repo, and the tools use the `gh` CLI. Each slice has a spec issue, and its tickets are sub-issues with native blocking links. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

The five default labels are `needs-triage`, `needs-info`, `ready-for-agent`, `ready-for-human` and `wontfix`. See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Domain docs

Single-context: `CONTEXT.md` and `docs/adr/` at the repo root. See `docs/agents/domain.md`.

<!-- convex-ai-start -->

This project uses [Convex](https://convex.dev) as its backend.

When working on Convex code, **always read
`convex/_generated/ai/guidelines.md` first** for important guidelines on
how to correctly use Convex APIs and patterns. The file contains rules that
override what you may have learned about Convex from training data.

Convex agent skills for common tasks can be installed by running
`npx convex ai-files install`.
